Edit #001: >>3<<
BAR: global: def. >>3<<: expands afresh as >>3<<: evaluates to 3: in options
Expanding "FOO in options
Edit #001: >>(1+1)<<
FOO: global: def. >>(1+1)<<: expands afresh as >>(1+1)<<: evaluates to 2: in options
FOO: global: def. >>(1+1)<<: expands unchanged as >>(1+1)<<: evaluates to 2
BAR: global: def. >>3<<: expands unchanged as >>3<<: evaluates to 3
SYM: transient: def. >>((FOO) And (FOO SYM BAR) And (BAR))<<: insoluble, because of infinite regress
