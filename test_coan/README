Testing Coan
============

This directory contains the test harness that is built and executed by `make check' The test harness
executes each of the perl scripts (.pl files) in this directory. Any of these scripts can be run
independantly with a command like:

perl -I ../perl test_script.pl

If no options are passed to test_script.pl it will be run with the defaults that are used by
`make check'. The available options can be listed by running the script with the option --help
