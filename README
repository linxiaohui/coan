==========

See the file INSTALL for generic installation guidance.

Note that you must be root to run `make install'.

A successful installation in the default path (/usr/local) will create 2 files:

- The coan executable /usr/local/bin/coan
- The coan man page /usr/local/man/man1/coan.1.gz

You can execute `coan version' at the command prompt to test that coan
is correctly installed, and you can execute `man coan' to test that the man
page is correctly installed.
